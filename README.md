### Hi there üëãüèΩ

My official name is Triane (Tree-Awn) Peart but I also go by (Tree-Ane) and Ana. My pronouns are She/They/Them/Zer and I am a Full Stack Engineer at Pursuit with a passionate love of art and design.

Where most people see a jumbled mess, I see something interesting for me to craft, which is why I entered the software field. It is my hope to utilize my lifelong love of literature CSS and over all web development to create something beautiful one day and happily welcome you along for an incredible ride.
